* Space Game
Games are pieces of software that fascinated me for my entire life, but I have never given a truly chance to game development during my years of software development... until now! This is my first attempt of making a playable game. Here I will describe everything that I learned while working on this project. Hope it someday helps someone.

This game is entirely made by me without using code, assets or music generated by AI in any step of the process. AI has been used while doing this project for research purposes, clarification of study materials and also for suggestions on finding free software like DAWs, pixel art editors.
